So far, one main bug I found, when searching in rfc-index.txt for the term "Simple", I get a result of
" "  (for entry 3781)
This doesn't end up with the number associated, because the gulper hasn't gone back far enough and grabbed the previous line.
Might have to think how the Gulper reads the file. So far, I've been doing it line by line.
