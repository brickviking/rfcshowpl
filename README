The rfcshow program searches and displays Requests For Comment (rfc)
documents in text format, either as plain text files or compressed with
any of bzip2, gzip or lzma.

To come:
* documents in pdf/ps/html formats.
* download and compression of documents not already fetched.
* update locally stored documents to match available documents.

I (brickviking) am providing the hosting and initial concepts, and some
code, Zero_Dogg is providing other code, and lots of his experience.

At the moment, the instructions are really really simple:
* Install the following perl modules.
  + File::Slurp
  + Curses::UI and Curses
  + Compress::Zlib
  + Compress::Bzip2
* Install the lzma package (or compile/install it) - this program uses
  the binary program called unlzma from the package.
* Create a directory to store rfc documents in - several ideas
  are:
  + /usr/share/doc/rfc
  + /usr/local/share/doc/rfc
  + $HOME/rfcs
  + $HOME/rfcshow
  N.B. Debian also stores RFCs in subdirectories, I'm not aware of how
  the mapping is done, nor even if it's up to date.
* make the rfcshow script executable. (chmod +x rfcshow)
* execute it.
* Install it in a directory, if necessary.
