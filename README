The rfcshow program downloads, stores, searches and displays
Requests For Comment (rfc) documents in text/pdf/ps/html, though I may
focus purely on txt at the moment. I (brickviking) am providing the hosting
and initial concepts, and some code, Zero_Dogg is providing most of the code,
and lots of his experience.

At the moment, the instructions are really really simple:
* Install Curses::UI and Curses perl modules.
* make the rfcshow script executable.
* execute it.
